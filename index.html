    Since the beginning of the year the number of API users has doubled to over 1400 API keys. That's over 5 new API keys being created per day!
    <br/> <br/>
    So what is being built? Nobody really knows.
    <br/> <br/>
    There is no way for people to know that there not only multiple Windows Phone 8 apps, but also Blackberry options. Developers can't get a head start on building even more Strava apps by leveraging user-built SDKs, because they can't get to them. The next budding Veloviewer.com might dwindle due to lack of exposure.
    <br/> <br/>
    It's time to provide a place to list, incentivize, &amp; showcase what people are doing with our API. It is time for a new <a href="developers.html">http://www.strava.com/developers</a> page.</font>
