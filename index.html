    <font size="4">Since the beginning of the year the number of API keys has doubled. Think about that, doubled. That's 5+ new API keys being created every day, over 1400 possible uses of our API out there and yet we have no way to publicize it. We literally have no idea what people are doing with our data, let alone external people.</font>
    <br/> <br/>
    <font size="4"> The next budding Veloviewer.com might never reach critical mass due to lack of exposure. Athletes have no way to know that there are not only multiple 3rd party Windows Phone 8 apps for Strava, but also Blackberry options. Developers can't leverage any of the existing user-built SDKs and jumpstart even more Strava apps because they can't get to them.</font>
    <br/> <br/>
    <font size="5">It's time to provide a place to list, incentivize, &amp; showcase what people are doing with our API.
